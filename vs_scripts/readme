***************************

Version 1.0
March 2012

Part 1: Install VomsSnooper

The VomsSnooper.tar file is at http://hep.ph.liv.ac.uk/~sjones/
Download it and put it ~/somewhere/good, e.g.

mkdir -p  ~/somewhere/good
cd  ~/somewhere/good
wget -O VomsSnooper.tar http://hep.ph.liv.ac.uk/~sjones/VomsSnooper.tar

cd  ~/somewhere/good

tar -xvf VomsSnooper.tar

cd VomsSnooper

Part 2: Use VomsSnooper

./makeMyVomsData.sh

Part 3: Reference

VomsSnooper takes five arguments;
--xmlfile : an file of VOID data from CICS portal
--myvos   : a list of the VOS I want to extract and support
--outfile : the file to print VOs that need to be in SID format (see below).
--vodfile : a list of VOs that need to be in VOD format (see below)
--voddir  : the directory where to put VODs (see below)

You must provide them all, even if some are empty files!

VOD format or SID format.
************************

The VO data in your site-info.def is called SID format data, or SIDS.
Sadly, when VOs get DNS style names (t2k.org) the site-info.def file
is unsuitable for them. Instead, they go in a directory, called vo.d.
Each VO has its own file - these are called VODs. Thus VomsSnooper
supports the idea of formatting the output in SID format (which
goes in --outfile x) or VOD format (which go is discrete files
under the --voddir vo.d dir).

Good luck. Let me know about problems.
