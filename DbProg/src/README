These directories contain the examples from Database Programming with
JDBC and Java, 2nd Edition. Each example that is specific to a
particular chapter appears in the subdirectory named for that
chapter. For example, the GuestBookServlet class from Chapter 3
appears in the chapter3/ directory. The examples that span multiple
chapters, such as the code from the banking application, appear in the
etc/ directory.

Any example that requires any special information to get it running
has that information listed in the README in the example's
directory. For example, directions on how to run the banking
application appear in etc/README.

You are granted full, unrestricted permission to use all of the
example code from my book in any way, shape or form. You do not need
to email me or O'Reilly requesting permission. It would be nice,
however, to hear about places in which it is being used, so please do
drop me an email!

If you have any troubles, please do not hesitate to contact me. My
email address (which I do not publish here for fear of harvesting by
spammers) is in the Preface of the book.
