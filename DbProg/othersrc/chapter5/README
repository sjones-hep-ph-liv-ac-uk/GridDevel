I changed line 11 of Interest.java to point to the mSQL-JDBC row set
class so that the example would compile. Naturally, you should change
the example to reference whatever row set implementation you have
handy.

Also, it follows, this example will only run with a copy of the
mSQL-JDBC driver lying around with an mSQL database.
