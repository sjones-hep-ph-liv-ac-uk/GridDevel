The GuestBookServlet example differs a bit from the example in the
book. I modified it to be placed inside a .shtml file using
server-side Java servlet tags. The guestbook.shtml file is the file in
which I call this servlet. On my server, I gave it the server alias of
gb. Remember to configuration your initialization parameters when you
deploy the servlet!

You can view the servlet (slightly modified backwards to JDBC 1.2
since my servlet engine does not support JDK 1.2) at
